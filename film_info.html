            <p>While aspects of film, animation, and video editng have always interested me,
                I began my formal training in the prestigious Ballard High School Digital Film Making Program. It was
                here I wrote, produced, lit, edited, puppeteered, and cameod in several awarded shorts. Since then, my
                work has been relegated to smaller video-editing projects -
                editing along side writing remains my greatest skill in the field.</p>

            <p>As part of the Society for Advanced Rocket Propulsion business team, I was tasked to make a video
                showcasing a years worth of work at the club's largest event: unveiling. After pouring through hours of
                footage (some of it taken myself), texturing, lighting, and rendering our CAD model, and co-writing an
                epic classic rock song, I put together this video for its premiere infront of roughly 300 people.</p>
